Using ML methods to forecast energy demand via weather data
This is an exploratory project I am doing to help improve data science / machine learning skills

Project Goal:

Build a machine learning model to forecast natural gas demand using historical weather data (HDD/CDD) and energy usage patterns. This project demonstrates how atmospheric data can drive business-critical decisions in energy markets.
